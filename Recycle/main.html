        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our Recyclables Classifier demo! Our advanced machine learning model is designed to identify various recyclable materials from images, making recycling easier and more efficient. By classifying items accurately and providing detailed recycling information, our tool helps reduce waste and promote sustainable practices.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Recyclables Classifier leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is particularly effective for image recognition tasks. The model was trained on a diverse dataset of labeled images, encompassing different types of recyclable materials. When you upload an image, the following steps occur:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The image is resized and normalized to fit the model's input requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The CNN processes the image and predicts the material type based on learned patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> The model outputs the predicted class along with the confidence level, and relevant recycling information is displayed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>The Recyclables Classifier can be utilized in various settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recycling Facilities:</strong> Automate the sorting process to improve efficiency and accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Programs:</strong> Teach students about recycling and sustainability through interactive tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Applications:</strong> Empower users to easily identify recyclable materials and follow proper disposal practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Drawbacks/Negative Effects</h2>
        <p>While the Recyclables Classifier offers numerous benefits, it has some limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Misclassification:</strong> The model may occasionally misclassify items, particularly if images are unclear or contain multiple materials.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependence on Image Quality:</strong> High-quality images are crucial for accurate predictions. Poor lighting or angle can affect the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Need for Continuous Updates:</strong> The recycling landscape is constantly evolving, necessitating regular updates to the model and dataset to maintain accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
